## Messages On A Scheduled Interval

Some messages will be repeatedly sent to chat in a scheduled manner, with the user able to customize the interval time between each message.

Currently, the only messages that will loop repeatedly are:

`prime` - Sends a Twitch Prime advertisement message

`water` - Sends a reminder to the streamer to drink water, calculating how much water they should drink to maintain optimal hydration by using stream uptime data.

`stretch` - Sends a reminder for the streamer to stretch every 20 minutes or 40 minutes.

## Custom Commands

Custom commands can be set by using the following schema:

`!cmd OPERATION ARGS`

The bot is still under development and not yet finished. Also working on Music Integration with Spotify.
